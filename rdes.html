<h3>The Real-time PCR Data Essential Spreadsheet Format (RDES)</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
Although the Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML) is a comprehensive and advanced format for the documentation,
    storage and analysis of qPCR data, it may be due to its XML nature and rich feature set to overwhelming for some
    applications. The Real-time PCR Data Essential Spreadsheet Format (RDES) was designed as an simple export format
    for raw qPCR data using classic spreadsheet tables. Furthermore, RDES files can be easily used to create RDML files
    which allow to add additional information in tools like RDML-Edit (part of the RDML-Tools).
</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>
The spreadsheet table must use UTF-8 encoding, Linux newline characters (\n) and tabs (\t) as column separators. Dot
    must be the decimal separator. The file ending should be tsv, but csv and txt are also acceptable.
    <strong>The first six columns must be Well, Sample, Sample Type, Target, Target Type and Dye.</strong>
    The well should be given as letter number
    combination like A10. The sample column provides the user provided sample names. Sample type must be one of the
    3-4 letter codes: unkn - unknown sample, ntc - non template control, nac - no amplification control, std - standard
    sample, ntp - no target present, nrt - minusRT, pos - positive control or opt - optical calibrator sample. Samples
    with the same sample name in column 2 must have the same sample type in column 3. If sample types are not collected,
    use unkn for column 3. The target column provides the user provided target names. Target Type must be a 3 letter
    code toi - target of interest or ref - reference target. If target types are not collected, use toi for column 5.
    In dye the dye name should be given, like CYBR or the measurement frequency like 450nm. Targets with the same
    target name in column 4 must have the same target type in column 5 and dye in column 6.
    <strong>From column 7 the raw data follow. In the first row either the cycle is given as integer (amplification
    data) or the temperature in degree Celsius is given as floating point number (melting data).</strong>
    Amplification data and melting curve data need to be
    provided in two independent files. Below the measured raw data follow.
</p>
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT: The fluorescence values must be raw values as initially measured by the machine. It is essential
    that no baseline correction was performed on this data.</strong>

<h4>Details</h4>
<p>
Experience from the RDML format suggested an improved compatibility if all details are spelled out as explicit as
    possible.
</p>
<p class="hanging">
<strong>1. Data Format</strong></p>
<p class="hanging">
1.1. The files must be a plain text file. The file ending should be tsv, but csv and txt are also acceptable.</p>
<p class="hanging">
1.2. The file must use UTF-8 encoding.</p>
<p class="hanging">
1.3. The file must use Linux newline characters (\n).</p>
<p class="hanging">
1.4. The file must use tabs (\t) as column separators. Tabs may not occur in any text within cells of the table. If
    present, they should be replaced by spaces. Text in cells therefore can not contain tabs and cells may not be
    enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
<p class="hanging">
1.5. Dot must be the decimal separator. No further indicator for 1000 blocks should be used in numbers.</p>
<p class="hanging">
<strong>2. Columns describing the plate layout</strong></p>
<p class="hanging">
2.1. Well: The content of the cell in row 1, column 1 must be Well. In the rows below in column 1 the well should be
    given as upper case letter + number combination like A10 and resemble the labeling of plates. If qPCR machines do
    not use a two dimensional setup like for example rotor machines, the positions should be given with a preceding A.
    Empty wells can be left out, the numbers do not have to be free of gaps. If more than one letter is required,
    the same number of letters must be used in all wells.</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.2. Sample: The content of the cell in row 1, column 2 must be Sample. In the rows below in column 2 the user
    provided sample names follow. The names should be human readable.</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.3. Sample Type: The content of the cell in row 1, column 3 must be Sample Type. In the rows below in column 3 the
    sample type must be given as one of the 3 to 4 letter codes:</p>
<p class="inblock">
     unkn - unknown sample<br>
     ntc  - non template control<br>
     nac  - no amplification control<br>
     std  - standard sample<br>
     ntp  - no target present<br>
     nrt  - minusRT<br>
     pos  - positive control<br>
     opt  - optical calibrator sample</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.4. Target: The content of the cell in row 1, column 4 must be Target. In the rows below in column 4 the user
    provided target names follow. The names should be human readable.</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.5. Target Type: The content of the cell in row 1, column 5 must be Target Type. In the rows below in column 5 the
    target type must be given as one of the 3 letter codes:</p>
<p class="inblock">
     toi - target of interest<br>
     ref - reference target</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.6. Dye: The content of the cell in row 1, column 6 must be Dye. In the rows below in column 6 a human readable dye
    description should be provided. If the dye may be not be provided by the user, the measured fluorescence can be
    given for example as 520nm.</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.7. Limiting conditions and usage notes</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.7.1. Samples with the same sample name in column 2 must have the same sample type in column 3.</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.7.2. If sample types are not collected, use unkn for column 3.</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.7.3. Targets with the same target name in column 4 must have the same target type in column 5 and dye in column 6.</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.7.4. Targets detecting the same gene using different primers or a different dye must use different target names.</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.7.5. If target types are not collected, use toi for column 5.</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.7.6. Multiplex data require a separate row for each measured color. In a multiplex reaction, the columns 1-3 are
    identical and the columns 4-6 must differ to reflect the different targets and dyes.</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.7.7. Technical replicates should use the same sample name and target name. The columns 2-6 will be identical between
    technical replicates.</p>
<p class="hanging">
</p>
<p class="hanging">
<strong>3. Columns with the fluorescence data</strong></p>
<p class="hanging">
3.1. The first row gives the cycle as integer (amplification data) or the temperature in degree Celsius as floating
    point number (melting data). For each cycle or temperature a individual column is created.</p>
<p class="hanging">
3.2. From row 2 and column 7 the fluorescence values for the respective cycle (columns) and well/sample/target (rows)
    follow.</p>
<p class="hanging"><strong>
3.3. IMPORTANT: The fluorescence values must be raw values as initially measured by the machine. It is essential that
    no baseline correction was performed on this data.</strong></p>
<p class="hanging">
3.4. Amplification data and melting curve data need to be provided in two independent files. The columns 1-6 of these
    two files are usually identical.</p>
<p class="hanging">
3.5. The decimal separator should be a dot.</p>
<p class="hanging">
3.6. Fractional cycles or more than one measurement per cycle are not supported. The given numbers must reflect the
    actual cycles. If for example only every second cycle would be measured, the columns would be labeled 1, 3, 5
    and so on.</p>
