    <p>The RDML file format is a recommended element in the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines (<a href="http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19246619" target="_blank">Bustin et al., Clinical Chemistry, 2009</a>).</p>

	   The aim of MIQE, coordinated by a group of research-active scientists and coordinated under the umbrella of <a href="http://www.mibbi.org"
target="_blank">MIBBI</a> (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) is to provide authors, reviewers
       and editors specifications for the minimum information that must be reported for a qPCR experiment in order to ensure its relevance, accuracy, correct
       interpretation and repeatability. A checklist, which should be submitted along with the paper, is available for authors in preparing a manuscript employing qPCR</p>
