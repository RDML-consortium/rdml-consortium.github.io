<p>The international RDML consortium was founded to develop and maintain the RDML data exchange
    format. The core team is currently formed by Andreas Untergasser, Steve Lefever,
    Jan Hellemans, Jan M Ruijter and Jo Vandesompele. All interested parties are welcome to join
    <a href="impressum.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The RDML consortium is organized in a key developer group, a member community and supporters.
    The task of the key developer group is to discuss the comments and requests with the members
    and unite them into new RDML Recommendations.</p>

<p>Therefore, a new RDML Recommendation progresses through four maturity levels :</p>

<span style="margin-left:50px;">1. Working Draft (WD)</span><br/>
<span style="margin-left:50px;">2. Candidate Recommendation (CR)</span><br/>
<span style="margin-left:50px;">3. Proposed Recommendation (PR)</span><br/>
<span style="margin-left:50px;">4. RDML Recommendation (REC)</span><br/>
