  <h3>The RDML Consortium</h3>
  <p>The international RDML consortium was founded to develop and maintain the RDML data exchange
    format. The core team is currently formed by Andreas Untergasser, Steve Lefever,
    Jan Hellemans, Jan M Ruijter and Jo Vandesompele. All interested parties are welcome to join
    <a href="impressum.html">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>The RDML consortium is organized in a key developer group, a member community and supporters.
    The task of the key developer group is to discuss the comments and requests with the members
    and unite them into new RDML Recommendations.
  </p>
  <p>Therefore, a new RDML Recommendation progresses through four maturity levels :
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Working Draft (WD)</li>
    <li>Candidate Recommendation (CR)</li>
    <li>Proposed Recommendation (PR)</li>
    <li>RDML Recommendation (REC)</li>
  </ol>
